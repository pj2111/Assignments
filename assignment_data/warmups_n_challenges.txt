31/01: Start of Warmups & Problem listing
Suggestion: 
    a) Write functions for doing the required processing
    b) Write atleast 2 test cases for testing out the functions as you code 
    c) Write comments on each step in the functions
- Problems(Set 1):
    1) Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.Display the quotation and author as shown in the example
        input >> What is the quote: “Opportunities don't happen, you create them.”
        input >> Who said it: Chris Grosser
        output >> Chris Grosser says “Opportunities don't happen, you create them.”

- Solution - E1_Quotes_and_Authors.ipynb
- Pseudocode - 
        1)take input from user save in quote
        2)take second input form user and save in auth
        3)print aut says quote










- Problems(Set 2):
    2) Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement and the year you can retire. It should
        prompt for your current age and the age you want to retire and display the output as shown in the example that follows.
        input >> What is your age now? : 35
        input >> What age you will retire? : 75
        output >> You have 40  years until you retire. its 2024, you can retire in 2064

    3) Count the freq of a given word occurences in the provided sentence. Word can be like "nice" 
        input >> this is a nice list of words to make a nice python code.
        output >> 2

    4) Create a Volume calculator program that accepts many 3d shapes like sphere, cone, cube, cuboid, etc.
    Program should ask for the appropriate dimension of the given shape, and then return the volume
        input >> What is the shape you have in mind: cube
        input >> What is the length of cube side: 21
        output >> The cube has volume of 9261
    5) Given a number convert it to years, months and days
    6) Write a python code that chks whether a string is a pangram. (contains all letters in english)
    7) count number of vowels in given string
