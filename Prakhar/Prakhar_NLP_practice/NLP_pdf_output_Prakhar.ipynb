It’s common\\nto have a native mobile application reading and writing data\\nto a central back end written in a server-side language.

What You Learned Modern programs rely on third-party services, so it’s good to know how to consume them, but you’ll most likely find yourself using this pattern in your own work. It’s common to have a native mobile application reading and writing data to a central back end written in a server-side language. Web applications routinely use client-side JavaScript to work with server-side JSON APIs. The experience you gain from these exercises is in great demand. Now it’s time to put together everything you’ve learned by tackling some more robust programs. Chapter 9. Working with External Services   ',\n",

It’s common\\nto have a native mobile application reading and writing data\\nto a central back end written in a server-side language.
