Saying Hello
The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn
to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input.
So create a program that prompts for your name and prints
a greeting using your name.

Example Output
What is your name? Brian
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
Constraint
• Keep the input, string concatenation, and output sepa-
rate.

Challenges
• Write a new version of the program without using any
variables.
• Write a version of the program that displays different
greetings for different people. This would be a good
challenge to try after you’ve completed the exercises in

Counting the Number of Characters
Create a program that prompts for an input string and dis-
plays output that shows the input string and the number of
characters the string contains.

Example Output
What is the input string? Homer
Homer has 5 characters.

Constraints
• Be sure the output contains the original string.
• Use a single output statement to construct the output.
• Use a built-in function of the programming language to
determine the length of the string.

Challenges
• If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter
something into the program.
• Implement this program using a graphical user interface
and update the character counter every time a key is
pressed. If your language doesn’t have a particularly
friendly GUI library, try doing this exercise with HTML
and JavaScript instead.

Printing Quotes
Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end
of a string. But sometimes we need to print out the quotation
marks themselves by using
Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.
Display the quotation and author as shown in the example
output.

Example Output
What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids
you're looking for."

Constraints
• Use a single output statement to produce this output,
using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
• If your language supports string interpolation or string
substitution, don’t use it for this exercise. Use string
concatenation instead.

Challenge
• In
working with lists of data. Modify this program so that
instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you cre-
ate a structure that holds quotes and their associated
attributions and then display all of the quotes using the
format in the example. An array of maps would be a
good choice.

Mad Lib
Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story tem-
plate with blanks for words. You, or another player, then
construct a list of words and place them into the story, cre-
ating an often silly or funny story as a result.
Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun,
a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a
story that you create.

Example Output
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly
Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!

Constraints
• Use a single output statement for this program.
• If your language supports string interpolation or string
substitution, use it to build up the output.

Challenges
• Add more inputs to the program to expand the story.
• Implement a branching story, where the answers to
questions determine how the story is constructed. You’ll

Simple Math
You’ll often write programs that deal with numbers. And
depending on the programming language you use, you’ll
have to convert the inputs you get to numerical data types.
Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Print the
sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers as
shown in the example output:

Example Output
What is the first number? 10
What is the second number? 5
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2

Constraints
• Values coming from users will be strings. Ensure that
you convert these values to numbers before doing the
math.
• Keep the inputs and outputs separate from the numerical
conversions and other processing.
• Generate a single output statement with line breaks in
the appropriate spots.

Challenges
• Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as
numeric values. Don’t allow the user to proceed if the
value entered is not numeric.
• Don’t allow the user to enter a negative number.
• Break the program into functions that do the computa-
tions. You’ll explore functions in
on page 45
• Implement this program as a GUI program that automat-
ically updates the values when any value changes.

Retirement Calculator
Your computer knows what the current year is, which means
you can incorporate that into your programs. You just have
to figure out how your programming language can provide
you with that information.
Create a program that determines how many years you have
left until retirement and the year you can retire. It should
prompt for your current age and the age you want to retire
and display the output as shown in the example that follows.

Example Output
What is your current age? 25
At what age would you like to retire? 65
You have 40 years left until you can retire.
It's 2015, so you can retire in 2055.

Constraints
• Again, be sure to convert the input to numerical data
before doing any math.
• Don’t hard-code the current year into your program.
Get it from the system time via your programming lan-
guage.

Challenge
• Handle situations where the program returns a negative
number by stating that the user can already retire.
What You Learned
These problems were pretty simple, but hopefully they got
you thinking about keeping input, processing, and output
separate. When programs are simple, it’s tempting to just
do some math or string concatenation inside the program’s
output statements, but as your programs get more complex,
you’ll find you need to break things into reusable compo-
nents. You’ll be glad you were disciplined from the start.
Head on over to the next chapter. It’s time to do some more
serious math.

Pizza Party
Division isn’t always exact, and sometimes you’ll write
programs that will need to deal with the leftovers as a whole
number instead of a decimal.
Write a program to evenly divide pizzas. Prompt for the
number of people, the number of pizzas, and the number of
slices per pizza. Ensure that the number of pieces comes out
even. Display the number of pieces of pizza each person
should get. If there are leftovers, show the number of leftover
pieces.

Example Output
How many people? 8
How many pizzas do you have? 2
8 people with 2 pizzas
Each person gets 2 pieces of pizza.
There are 0 leftover pieces.

Challenges
• Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as
numeric values. Don’t allow the user to proceed if the
value entered is not numeric.
• Alter the output so it handles pluralization properly,
for example:
Each person gets 2 pieces of pizza.
or
Each person gets 1 piece of pizza.
Handle the output for leftover pieces appropriately as
well.

and quantities of three items. Calculate the subtotal of the
items. Then calculate the tax using a tax rate of 5.5%. Print
out the line items with the quantity and total, and then print
out the subtotal, tax amount, and total.

Example Output
Enter the price of item 1: 25
Enter the quantity of item 1: 2
Enter the price of item 2: 10
Enter the quantity of item 2: 1
Enter the price of item 3: 4
Enter the quantity of item 3: 1
Subtotal: $64.00
Tax: $3.52
Total: $67.52

Constraints
• Keep the input, processing, and output parts of your
program separate. Collect the input, then do the math
operations and string building, and then print out the
output.
• Be sure you explicitly convert input to numerical data
before doing any calculations.

Challenges
• Revise the program to ensure that prices and quantities
are entered as numeric values. Don’t allow the user to

Computing Simple Interest
Computing simple interest is a great way to quickly figure
out whether an investment has value. It’s also a good way
to get comfortable with explicitly coding the order of opera-
tions in your programs.
Create a program that computes simple interest. Prompt for
the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time,
and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).
The formula for simple interest is
the principal amount,
number of years the amount is invested, and
at the end of the investment.

Example Output
Enter the principal: 1500
Enter the rate of interest: 4.3
Enter the number of years: 4
After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will
be worth $1758.

Constraints
• Prompt for the rate as a percentage (like
Divide the input by 100 in your program.
• Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the
next penny.
• Ensure that the output is formatted as money.

Challenges
• Ensure that the values entered for principal, rate, and
number of years are numeric and that the program will
not let the user proceed without valid inputs.
• Alter the program to use a function called
pleInterest

Determining Compound Interest
Simple interest is something you use only when making a
quick guess. Most investments use a compound interest
formula, which will be much more accurate. And this formu-

Write a program to compute the value of an investment
compounded over time. The program should ask for the
starting amount, the number of years to invest, the interest
rate, and the number of periods per year to compound.

Tax Calculator
You don’t always need a complex control structure to solve
simple problems. Sometimes a program requires an extra
step in one case, but in all other cases there’s nothing to do.
Write a simple program to compute the tax on an order
amount. The program should prompt for the order amount
and the state. If the state is “WI,” then the order must be
charged 5.5% tax. The program should display the subtotal,
tax, and total for Wisconsin residents but display just the
total for non-residents.

Example Output
What is the order amount? 10
What is the state? WI
The subtotal is $10.00.
The tax is $0.55.
The total is $10.55.

it to the legal driving age of sixteen. If the user is sixteen or
older, then the program should display “You are old enough
to legally drive.” If the user is under sixteen, the program
should display “You are not old enough to legally drive.”

Example Output
What is your age? 15
You are not old enough to legally drive.
Or
What is your age? 35
You are old enough to legally drive.

• A very weak password contains only numbers and is
fewer than eight characters.
• A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than
eight characters.
• A strong password contains letters and at least one
number and is at least eight characters.
• A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and
special characters and is at least eight characters.

Example Output
The password '12345' is a very weak password.
The password 'abcdef' is a weak password.
The password 'abc123xyz' is a strong password.
The password '1337h@xor!' is a very strong password.

Constraints
• Create a
password as its argument and returns a value you can
evaluate to determine the password strength. Do not
have the function return a string—you may need to
support multiple languages in the future.
• Use a single output statement.

Challenge
• Create a GUI application or web application that dis-
plays graphical feedback as well as text feedback in real
time. As someone enters a password, determine its
strength and display the result.

Months to Pay Off a Credit Card
It can take a lot longer to pay off your credit card balance
than you might realize. And the formula for figuring that
out isn’t pretty. Hiding the formula’s complexity with a
function can help you keep your code organized.
Write a program that will help you determine how many
months it will take to pay off a credit card balance. The
program should ask the user to enter the balance of a credit
card and the APR of the card. The program should then
return the number of months needed.
The formula for this is
n = −

Example Output
What is your balance? 5000
What is the APR on the card (as a percent)? 12
What is the monthly payment you can make? 100
It will take you 70 months to pay off this card.

Constraints
• Prompt for the card’s APR. Do the division internally.
• Prompt for the APR as a percentage, not a decimal.
• Use a function called
accepts the balance, the APR, and the monthly payment
as its arguments and returns the number of months.
Don’t access any of these values outside the function.
• Round fractions of a cent up to the next cent.

Chapter: 27
Validating Inputs
Large functions aren’t very usable or maintainable. It makes
a lot of sense to break down the logic of a program into
smaller functions that do one thing each. The program can
then call these functions in sequence to perform the work.
Write a program that prompts for a first name, last name,
employee ID, and ZIP code. Ensure that the input is valid
according to these rules:
• The first name must be filled in.
• The last name must be filled in.
• The first and last names must be at least two characters
long.
• An employee ID is in the format AA-1234. So, two let-
ters, a hyphen, and four numbers.
• The ZIP code must be a number.
Display appropriate error messages on incorrect data.

Example Output
Enter the first name: J
Enter the last name:
Enter the ZIP code: ABCDE
Enter an employee ID:
A12-1234
"J" is not a valid first name. It is too short.
The last name must be filled in.
The ZIP code must be numeric.
A12-1234 is not a valid ID.
Or
Enter the first name: Jimmy
Enter the last name: James
Enter the ZIP code: 55555
Enter an employee ID:
TK-421
There were no errors found.

Constraints
• Create a function for each type of validation you need
to write. Then create a
in all of the input data and invokes the specific valida-
tion functions.
• Use a single output statement to display the outputs.

Chapter: 28
Adding Numbers
In previous programs, you asked the user for repeated input
by writing the input statements multiple times. But it’s more
efficient to use loops to deal with repeated input.
Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and
computes the total of the numbers.

Example Output
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
The total is 15.

Constraints
• The prompting must use repetition, such as a counted
loop, not three separate prompts.
• Create a flowchart before writing the program.

Challenges
• Modify the program to prompt for how many numbers
to add, instead of hard-coding the value. Be sure you
convert the input to a number before doing the compar-
ison.
• Modify the program so that it only adds numbers and
silently rejects non-numeric values. Count these invalid
entries as attempts anyway. In other words, if the
number of numbers to add is 5, your program should
still prompt only five times.

Handling Bad Input
The rule of 72 is a quick method for estimating how long it
will take to double your investment, by taking the number
72
tool that helps you figure out if the stock, bond, or savings
account is right for you. It’s also a good program to write to
test for and prevent bad input because computers can’t
divide by zero. And instead of exiting the program when
the user enters invalid input, you can just keep prompting
for inputs until you get one that’s valid.
Write a quick calculator that prompts for the rate of return
on an investment and calculates how many years it will take
to double your investment.
The formula is
years = 72 / r
where

Example Output
What is the rate of return? 0
Sorry. That's not a valid input.
What is the rate of return? ABC
Sorry. That's not a valid input.
What is the rate of return? 4
It will take 18 years to double your initial investment.

Constraints
• Don’t allow the user to enter 0.
• Don’t allow non-numeric values.
• Use a loop to trap bad input, so you can ensure that the
user enters valid values.

Challenge
• Display a different error message when the user enters
0.

Karvonen Heart Rate
When you loop, you can control how much you increment
the counter; you don’t always have to increment by one.
When getting into a fitness program, you may want to figure
out your target heart rate so you don’t overexert yourself.
The Karvonen heart rate formula is one method you can use
to determine your rate. Create a program that prompts for
your age and your resting heart rate. Use the Karvonen for-
mula to determine the target heart rate based on a range of
intensities from 55% to 95%. Generate a table with the results
as shown in the example output. The formula is
TargetHeartRate = (((220 −age) −restingHR) × intensity) + restingHR

Example Output
Resting Pulse: 65
Age: 22
Intensity
| Rate
-------------|--------
55%
| 138 bpm
60%
| 145 bpm

85%
| 178 bpm
90%
| 185 bpm
95%
| 191 bpm

Constraints
• Don’t hard-code the percentages. Use a loop to incre-
ment the percentages from 55 to 95.
• Ensure that the heart rate and age are entered as num-
bers. Don’t allow the user to continue without entering
valid inputs.
• Display the results in a tabular format.

Challenge
• Implement this as a GUI program that allows the user
to use a slider control for the intensity, and update the
interface in real time as the slider moves.

Guess the Number Game
Write a Guess the Number game that has three levels of
difficulty. The first level of difficulty would be a number
between 1 and 10. The second difficulty set would be
between 1 and 100. The third difficulty set would be between
1 and 1000.
Prompt for the difficulty level, and then start the game. The
computer picks a random number in that range and prompts
the player to guess that number. Each time the player
guesses, the computer should give the player a hint as to
whether the number is too high or too low. The computer
should also keep track of the number of guesses. Once the
player guesses the correct number, the computer should
present the number of guesses and ask if the player would
like to play again.

Example Output
Let's play Guess the Number.
Pick a difficulty level (1, 2, or 3): 1
I have my number. What's your guess? 1
Too low.
Guess again: 5
Too high. Guess again: 2
You got it in 3 guesses!
Play again? n
Goodbye!

Constraints
• Don’t allow any non-numeric data entry.
• During the game, count non-numeric entries as wrong
guesses.

Challenges
• Map the number of guesses taken to comments:
– 1 guess: “You’re a mind reader!”
– 2–4 guesses: “Most impressive.”
– 3–6 guesses: “You can do better than that.”
– 7 or more guesses: “Better luck next time.”

then displays either “Yes,” “No,” “Maybe,” or “Ask again
later.”

Example Output
What's your question?
Will I be rich and famous?
Ask again later.
Constraint
• The value should be chosen randomly using a pseudo
random number generator. Store the possible choices
in a list and select one at random.

Employee List Removal
Sometimes you have to locate and remove an entry from a
list based on some criteria. You may have a deck of cards
and need to discard one so it’s no longer in play, or you may
need to remove values from a list of valid inputs once they’ve
been used. Storing the values in an array makes this process
easier. Depending on your language, you may find it safer
and more efficient to create a new array instead of modifying
the existing one.
Create a small program that contains a list of employee
names. Print out the list of names when the program runs
the first time. Prompt for an employee name and remove
that specific name from the list of names. Display the
remaining employees, each on its own line.

Example Output
There are 5 employees:
John Smith
Jackie Jackson
Chris Jones
Amanda Cullen
Jeremy Goodwin
Enter an employee name to remove: Chris Jones
There are 4 employees:
John Smith
Jackie Jackson

Constraint
• Use an array or list to store the names.

Challenges
• If the user enters a name that’s not found, print out an
error message stating that the name does not exist.

Computing Statistics
Statistics is important in our field. When measuring response
times or rendering times, it’s helpful to collect data so you
can easily spot abnormalities. For example, the standard
deviation helps you determine which values are outliers and
which values are within normal ranges.
Write a program that prompts for response times from a
website in milliseconds. It should keep asking for values
until the user enters “done.”
The program should print the average time (mean), the
minimum time, the maximum time, and the standard devi-
ation.
To compute the average (mean)
1.
Compute the sum of all values.
2.
Divide the sum by the number of values.
To compute the standard deviation
1.
Calculate the difference from the mean for each number
and square it.
2.
Compute the mean of the squared values.
3.
Take the square root of the mean.

Example Output
Enter a number: 100
Enter a number: 200
Enter a number: 1000
Enter a number: 300
Enter a number: done
Numbers: 100, 200, 1000, 300
The average is 400.
The minimum is 100.
The maximum is 1000.

the user for the minimum length, the number of special
characters, and the number of numbers. Then generate a
password for the user using those inputs.

How many special characters? 2
How many numbers? 2
Your password is

• Use lists to store the characters you’ll use to generate
the passwords.
• Add some randomness to the password generation.

Filtering Values
Sometimes input you collect will need to be filtered down.
Data structures and loops can make this process easier.

rated by spaces. Have the program print out a new list con-
taining only the even numbers.

Example Output
Enter a list of numbers, separated by spaces:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
The even numbers are 2 4 6 8.

• Convert the input to an array. Many languages can
easily convert strings to arrays with a built-in function
that splits apart a string based on a specified delimiter.
• Write your own algorithm—don’t rely on the language’s
built-in
• Use a function called
logic for this. The function takes in the old array and
returns the new array.

Product Search
Pulling data from a file into a complex data structure makes
parsing much simpler. Many programming languages sup-
port the JSON format, a popular way of representing data.
Create a program that takes a product name as input and
retrieves the current price and quantity for that product. The
product data is in a data file in the JSON format and looks
like this:
{
"products" : [
{"name": "Widget", "price": 25.00, "quantity": 5 },
{"name": "Thing", "price": 15.00, "quantity": 5 },
{"name": "Doodad", "price": 5.00, "quantity": 10 }
]
}
Print out the product name, price, and quantity if the product
is found. If no product matches the search, state that no
product was found and start over.

Example Output
What is the product name? iPad
Sorry, that product was not found in our inventory.

Word Finder
There will be times when you’ll need to read in one file,
modify it, and then write a modified version of that file to
a new file.
Given an input file, read the file and look for all occurrences
of the word
the modified file to a new file.

Example Output
Given the input file of
One should never utilize the word "utilize" in
writing. Use "use" instead.
The program should generate
One should never use the word "use" in
writing. Use "use" instead.

Constraints
• Prompt for the name of the output file.
• Write the output to a new file.

Challenges
• Modify the program to track the number of replacements
and report that to the screen when the program finishes.
• Create a configuration file that maps “bad” words to
“good” words and use this file instead of a hard-coded
value.
• Modify the program so it can handle a folder of files
instead of a single file.

Word Frequency Finder
Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block
of text is helpful for creating word clouds and other types
of word analysis. And it’s more useful when running it
against lots of text.
Create a program that reads in a file and counts the frequen-
cy of words in the file. Then construct a histogram displaying
the words and the frequency, and display the histogram to
the screen.

Example Output
Given the text file
badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom
snake badger badger badger
the program would produce the following output:
badger:
*******
mushroom: **
snake:
*
Constraint
• Ensure that the most used word is at the top of the report
and the least used words are at the bottom.

Challenges
• Use a graphical program and generate bar graphs.
• Test the performance of your calculation by providing
a very large input file, such as Shakespeare’s Macbeth.

Tweak your algorithm so that it performs the word
counting as fast as possible.
• Write the program in another language and compare
the processing times of the two implementations.

Who’s in Space?
Did you know you can find out exactly who’s in space right
now? The Open Notify API provides that information. Visit
http://api.open-notify
.org/astros.json
people are currently in space but also their names and which
spacecraft they’re on.
Create a program that pulls in this data and displays the
information from this API in a tabular format.

Example Output
There are 3 people in space right now:
Name
| Craft
--------------------|------
Gennady Padalka
| ISS
Mikhail Kornienko
| ISS
Scott Kelly
| ISS
Constraint
• Read the data directly from the API and parse the results
each time the program is run. Don’t download the data
as text and read it in.

Challenges
• Ensure that the width of the header is as long as the
longest value in the column.
• Don’t repeat the name of the craft—group all people by
craft.
• Can you reliably sort the results alphabetically by last
name? Be careful—some people have spaces in their
name, like “Mary Sue Van Pelt.”

Grabbing the Weather
Is it nice out today? Or should I grab my coat?
Using the OpenWeatherMap API at
current
returns the current temperature for the city.

Example Output
Where are you? Chicago IL
Chicago weather:
65 degrees Fahrenheit
Constraint
• Keep the processing of the weather feed separate from
the part of your program that displays the results.

Challenges
• The API gives the sunrise and sunset times, as well as
the humidity and a description of the weather. Display
that data in a meaningful way.
• The API gives the wind direction in degrees. Convert it
to words such as “North,” “West,” “South,” “South-
west,” or even “South-southwest.”
• Develop a scheme that lets the weather program tell you
what kind of day it is. If it’s 70 degrees and clear skies,
say that it’s a nice day out!
• Display the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
• Based on the information, determine if the person needs
a coat or an umbrella.

Movie Recommendations
The data provided by external services can give you a
jumping-off point to create your own application.
Write a program that displays information about a given
movie. Prompt for a search query and display the title, year,
rating, running time, and a synopsis, if one exists. Then, if
the audience score is above 80%, recommend that the user
watch this movie right now. If the score is below 50%, rec-
ommend that the user avoid the movie at all costs.

Example Output
Enter the name of a movie: Guardians of the Galaxy
Title: Guardians of the Galaxy
Year: 2014
Rating: PG-13
Running Time: 121 minutes
Description: From Marvel...
You should watch this movie right now!
Constraint
• Use the Rotten Tomatoes API at
toes.com/

Challenges
• Create a graphical version of the program. Display the
movie poster image along with the rating information
graphically.
• Investigate methods to cache the movie data you’ve
collected so that you aren’t constantly hitting the exter-
nal API. Provide a method to expire the cache.

Pushing Notes to Firebase
Some external services allow you to update data, not just
read it. Firebase

database so you can save data for web, mobile, and desktop
applications. And you can use it with any programming
language, thanks to its JSON-based API.
Create a simple command-line application that lets you save
and show notes, using Firebase to save the notes. The
application should support the following commands:
•
note.
• Use

Example Output
$
Your note was saved.
$
2050-12-31 - Learn how to invert binary trees
2050-12-30 - Notetaking on the command line is cool.

Constraints
• Create a configuration file that stores the API key.
• Use the REST documentation at
docs/rest/

Challenges
• Create a more generalized application that lets you
search for and view notes.
• Replace your implementation with one of the client
libraries.
• Add the ability to tag notes.

Creating Your Own Time Service
Consuming external services is one thing, but it’s important
to be able to create and consume your own service that others
can use, so you can support other developers who want to
use services you’ll provide.
Create a simple web service that returns the current time as
JSON data, such as:
Then create a client application that connects to the web
service, parses the response, and displays the time.

Example Output
The current time is 15:06:26 UTC January 4 2050.

Constraints
• In your server application, be sure to set the content
type to
• Build the server app with as little code as possible.

Challenges
• Build a new server that displays a random quote. Store
quotes in an array and pick one at random to display.
• Write a client-side component that displays the quotes
in a different language than the one you used for the
server.
What You Learned
Modern programs rely on third-party services, so it’s good
to know how to consume them, but you’ll most likely find
yourself using this pattern in your own work. It’s common
to have a native mobile application reading and writing data
to a central back end written in a server-side language. Web
applications routinely use client-side JavaScript to work with
server-side JSON APIs. The experience you gain from these
exercises is in great demand.
Now it’s time to put together everything you’ve learned by
tackling some more robust programs.

Todo List
Let’s start with the good-old trusty todo list, the “Hello,
World” of full programs. You’re going to write a command-
line todo list program that meets the following specifications:
• Prompt the user to enter a chore or task. Store the task
in a permanent location so that the task persists when
the program is restarted.
• Allow the user to enter as many tasks as desired but
stop entering tasks by entering a blank task.
the blank task.
• Display all the tasks.
• Allow the user to remove a task, to signify it’s been
completed.

Constraints
• Store the data in an external data source.
• If you’re using a server-side language, consider persist-
ing the data to Redis.
• Consider persisting the database to a third-party service
like Parse or Firebase.

Challenges
• Implement this in a web browser using only front-end
technologies. Investigate using IndexedDB to save the
items.
• Implement the front end as an Android or iPhone app,
but connect that front end to your own back end that
you write using a server-side language. Create your
own API for retrieving the list, creating a new item, and
marking an item as complete.

URL Shortener
Write a web application that allows users to take a long URL
and convert it to a shortened URL similar to
• The program should have a form that accepts the long
URL.
• The program should generate a short local URL like
/abc1234
together in a persistent data store.
• The program should redirect visitors to the long URL
when the short URL is visited.
• The program should track the number of times the short
URL is visited.
• The program should have a statistics page for the short
URL, such as
show the short URL, the long URL, and the number of
times the short URL was accessed.

Constraints
• This app must use a persistent data store that others can
use. That means a local, in-memory system isn’t appro-
priate.
• Don’t allow an invalid URL to be entered into the form.

Challenges
• Detect duplicate URLs. Don’t create a new short URL if
one already exists.
• Use Redis as your data store.
• Use RavenDB as your data store.
• Record the date and time each short URL was accessed,
and use a graphing library to graph the requests.

Text Sharing
Create a web application that lets users share a snippet of
text, similar to
follow these specifications:
• The user should enter the text into a text area and save
the text.
• The text should be stored in a data store.
• The program should generate a URL that can be used
to retrieve the saved text.
• When a user follows that URL, the text should be dis-
played, along with an invitation to edit the text.
• When a user clicks the Edit button, the text should be
copied and placed in the same interface used to create
new text snippets.
Constraint
• Use something other than a primary key for the URL,
such as a slug that you generate. Investigate SHA or
MD5 hashing.

Challenges
• Modify the program so that each paste supports Mark-
down formatting.
• Modify the program so that the
the existing node and keeps versions of previous notes.
• Implement an API and make a command-line, native,
or mobile application that can add new text snippets or
view snippets.
